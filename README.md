## Project Overview

Hate speech detection is an important and challenging task in today's online world. With the proliferation of social media platforms and online communities, the issue of hate speech has become a growing concern. This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based model to automatically identify hate speech in textual content.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from the [Google Scholars ACM Digital Library Crawler](https://github.com/saroarjahan/Google_sholars_ACM_digital_library_crawler). It includes a collection of research papers related to hate speech detection and related topics. The dataset is used for training, validation, and testing of the deep learning model.

## Research Paper

The research paper titled "[Hate Speech Detection and Tracking: A Systematic Review](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271597/1-s2.0-S0925231223X0023X/1-s2.0-S0925231223003557/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=...)‚Äù by Md Saroar Jahan and Mourad Oussalah is a key reference for this project. The paper provides insights into the challenges, techniques, and trends in hate speech detection using natural language processing and deep learning technologies.
